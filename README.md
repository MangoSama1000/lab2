# ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
# I was able to put alt tags on all my images in order for the image gallery to be accessible for people
# I used event handlers on the arrow tags and once the user clicks on it the image moves either to the right or left depending on which arrow they selected
# ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
# I tried to use media queries but I am not too sure if it was implemented correctly
# ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
# When I was putting my images in arrays in javascript and once i clicked live server there was no images present, I might have had bad code but after a while I choose to put my images in my html just so I could have a website to submit for this assignemnt

# Optional feedback
# I was watching youtube tutorials to learn how to build this website and websites like mdn docs or w3schools by asking questions
# I was trying to put a smooth scroll on my arrows but it didnt work but I was happy they worked in the end after a lot of struggles
